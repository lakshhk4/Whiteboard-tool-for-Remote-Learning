# Whiteboard-tool-for-Remote-Learning

This repository contains the source code of my Sectional Whiteboard prototype, which I created for the Crown Education Challenge.

As we witnessed in 2020, pandemics cause schools to shut down virtually overnight, and teachers and students are forced into online learning environments. Many teachers at my school used their computer’s trackpad to write on digital whiteboards, but quickly stopped because writing legibly with a trackpad was very time-consuming and difficult.

The current digital whiteboard applications only work effectively when one has a large touchscreen device, like an iPad; however, most teachers don’t have access to such devices, especially during a pandemic, and thereby do not use any whiteboard, compromising on their students’ learning.

I propose an alternative whiteboard app (and this repository contains the source code of my prototype), which allows the user to write effectively without the use of a large touchscreen device (ie. iPad)
